RPS Game 
# Rock Paper Scissors Final Project

This is my Java Rock Paper Scissors game for class. It has a GUI built with Swing where you play against the computer.

## Features
- Player vs CPU
- Countdown before result shows
- Score goes up as you play
- Game ends at 10 rounds
- Replay button to start over

## What's in this repo
- All my Java files
- Screenshots of the GUI
- My project write-up (with weekly updates and everything)
- UML and CRC were included in the planning doc

## Notes
I got the game working how I wanted. I didnâ€™t finish saving scores to a file but score tracking in the game works.
